# Receipt Enricher

Turn a phone photo of a grocery receipt into a structured, enriched breakdown.

You send a photo (Costco, Sprouts, Publix, etc.). The service extracts the line
items and prices, looks up a product image and a bit of metadata for each item
via **Tavily**, and gives you a shareable link to the full breakdown. Two ways
in: a **Telegram bot** and a **CLI**. Everything runs in containers and works
with **Docker or Podman**.

---

## How it works

```
                 ┌──────────────┐         ┌──────────────────────────────┐
   Telegram ───► │              │         │            worker            │
                 │   api (REST  │  BullMQ  │  OCR/vision → parse → Tavily │
   CLI / curl ─► │   + web view)│ ───────► │  enrich → summarize          │
                 │              │  (Redis) │                              │
                 └──────┬───────┘         └───────────────┬──────────────┘
                        │  durable receipt records (JSON + image)         │
                        └──────────────── shared volume ──────────────────┘
```

The flow:

1. **Ingest** — a receipt image arrives via the REST API. The Telegram bot is
   just another REST client: it downloads the photo and POSTs it to the same
   endpoint, so there is a single ingestion path.
2. **Queue** — the API saves the image + a record to disk, then enqueues a tiny
   job (`{ receiptId }`) on a **Redis-backed BullMQ queue**. The API responds
   `202 Accepted` immediately. Jobs survive restarts and retry with backoff, so
   incoming receipts are not dropped under load or transient failures.
3. **Process** (worker):
   - **Extract** the receipt — a vision model (Anthropic or OpenAI) returns
     structured line items directly, or Tesseract OCR produces raw text that a
     heuristic parser turns into items.
   - **Parse** into a canonical shape: `{ store, items[], totals }`.
   - **Enrich** each item through Tavily (image + title + snippet), cached in
     Redis so repeat items don't re-spend API credits.
   - **Summarize** and mark the record `done`.
4. **View** — open the link. The web page updates as you refresh; the same data
   is available as JSON.

**Graceful degradation:** with no API keys at all, it still runs — it falls back
to offline Tesseract OCR and simply skips enrichment. Add a Tavily key to get
images; add a vision key for much better item extraction.

**Receipt profiles (optional):** a *profile* runs a code **transformer** that
canonicalizes a parsed receipt — normalizing store names, dates, and item
descriptions — and stores the result separately with an auto-derived change log
(the original record is never modified). Apply one synchronously to an
already-processed receipt, asynchronously (`?async=1`), or pass a `profileId` at
upload time to run it automatically **after** OCR via a BullMQ flow
(`process-receipt` child → `applyProfile` parent). Two transformers ship today:
`usGrocery` (vision-clean receipts) and `tesseractGroceryUs` (repairs noisy
Tesseract output). See [`docs/RECEIPT-PROFILES.md`](docs/RECEIPT-PROFILES.md) and
the API reference in [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md).

**Products (final stage):** once a profile result exists, the **product
resolver** maps each cleaned line item to real product information — a title, a
description, and the top web link that substantiates it. The backend is a
configurable **resolver/adapter** picked by `PRODUCT_RESOLVER` (like
`OCR_PROVIDER` picks the OCR engine); the shipped `anthropic` resolver calls a
low-end model (`claude-haiku-4-5`) and grounds the link with Anthropic's
server-side web search. It runs by default after a profile is applied — so a
single upload goes OCR → profile → products via a 3-level BullMQ flow
(`process-receipt` → `applyProfile` → `resolveProducts`) — and is also runnable
on demand. See [Products in `docs/API.md`](docs/API.md#products).

## Components

| Service  | What it is                          | Toolchain        |
|----------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| `api`    | REST API + server-rendered web view | Node + Express   |
| `worker` | Pipeline (extract → enrich)         | Node + BullMQ    |
| `redis`  | Queue + enrichment cache            | Redis 7          |
| `bot`    | Telegram ingestion (optional)       | Node + Telegraf  |
| `cli`    | Lightweight client                  | **bash + curl**  |

The CLI is deliberately not Node — it's a single bash script that calls the REST
API with `curl` (and uses `jq` for pretty output if you have it). Nothing to
install.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose **or** Podman. With Podman, prefer **`podman-compose`**
  (the Python wrapper). Plain `podman compose` shells out to an external
  `docker-compose` provider that can't reach the rootless Podman socket in some
  setups (it fails with *"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"*); `podman-compose`
  drives the Podman CLI directly and is the tested path here.
- That's it for running. For local (non-container) development you'd also want
  Node ≥ 18.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Configure (works fine with everything blank — see "Modes" below)
cp .env.example .env
#   then edit .env to add keys you have (TAVILY_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, ...)

# 2. Build and start (pick your runtime). --no-cache forces a clean image
#    rebuild every run, so reused commands never serve stale layers.
docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d
#   — or, with Podman (use the hyphenated wrapper; -p pins the project name,
#     see "Podman notes" for why) —
podman-compose -p receipt-enricher up --build --no-cache -d

# 3. Make the CLI handy
chmod +x cli/receipts
export PATH="$PWD/cli:$PATH"      # or: alias receipts="$PWD/cli/receipts"

# 4. Check health, then upload a receipt photo
receipts health
receipts upload ~/Pictures/costco-receipt.jpg --wait

# 5. (optional) Upload and apply a receipt profile after OCR.
#    "usGrocery1" is seeded on first boot; it canonicalizes the store/date and
#    folds per-item discounts into the discounted line.
receipts upload ~/Pictures/costco-receipt.jpg --wait --profile usGrocery1
```

`upload --wait` blocks until processing finishes and prints the record plus a
`view:` URL. Open it in a browser, or just visit <http://localhost:8080> to see
all receipts.

With `--profile`, the worker runs OCR **then** applies the profile, and the
command also prints a `profile view:` URL — the HTML receipt with the profile
applied (discounts folded into their line items). Run `receipts list` or visit
<http://localhost:8080> to confirm the receipt was processed.

---

## Modes (what works with which keys)

| You have…                         | Extraction        | Enrichment        |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| nothing                           | Tesseract OCR     | skipped           |
| `TAVILY_API_KEY`                  | Tesseract OCR     | ✅ images/metadata |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (or OpenAI)   | ✅ vision model    | skipped           |
| both                              | ✅ vision model    | ✅ images/metadata |

For real receipts, a **vision model is strongly recommended** — raw Tesseract on
a crumpled phone photo is hit-or-miss, while a vision model reads the layout and
returns clean items. The default vision model is `claude-sonnet-4-6`; override
with `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, or set `VISION_PROVIDER=openai` with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

> Tesseract note: the English language data ships in the image
> (`tessdata/eng.traineddata`), so it runs fully offline — no CDN download. It
> can't read HEIC (convert iPhone photos to JPEG/PNG) and needs an upright,
> reasonably sharp image — a sideways photo reads as noise.

---

## Using it

### CLI

```bash
receipts upload <image> [--wait] [--profile <id|name>]
                                   # upload a photo; --wait blocks for results,
                                   # --profile applies a receipt profile after OCR
receipts status <id>               # full JSON record
receipts list                      # recent receipts
receipts wait <id>                 # poll until done/failed
receipts view <id>                 # print + open the web view
receipts health                    # API + Redis status
```

Point it at a remote host with `API_URL`:

```bash
API_URL=http://my-server:8080 receipts upload receipt.jpg --wait
```

A companion CLI, **`products`**, manages the product layer — notably the shared
product cache (snapshot it to a file and restore it, e.g. to seed a known cache
before an acceptance run so SKU lookups are served from cache, not live calls):

```bash
products cache export cache.json           # snapshot the cache to a file
products cache import cache.json [--flush]  # restore it (--flush clears first)
products cache stats                        # how many entries are cached
products resolvers                          # list resolvers + the active one
```

### Telegram bot

1. Create a bot with [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and copy the token.
2. Put it in `.env` as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...`.
3. Start the optional `bot` service via its profile:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile telegram up --build -d
   #   — or —
   podman-compose --profile telegram up --build -d
   ```
4. Send the bot a photo of a receipt. It replies with a link to the breakdown.

The link the bot sends is built from `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, so set that to an address
Telegram-side you can actually open (not `localhost` if you're on your phone).

### Raw REST API

```bash
# Upload (field name: "receipt")
curl -F "receipt=@receipt.jpg" http://localhost:8080/api/receipts
# -> 202 { "id": "...", "status": "queued", "statusUrl": "...", "viewUrl": "..." }

# Upload and apply a receipt profile after OCR (add a "profileId" field)
curl -F "receipt=@receipt.jpg" -F "profileId=usGrocery1" http://localhost:8080/api/receipts
# -> 202 { "id": "...", "profileId": "rp_...", "profileResultUrl": "...", ... }

curl http://localhost:8080/api/receipts/<id>     # one record (JSON)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/receipts          # list
# Web view:           http://localhost:8080/receipts/<id>/view
# Profile-applied view: http://localhost:8080/receipts/<id>/profileResults/usGrocery1/view
# Original photo:     http://localhost:8080/receipts/<id>/image
```

## Podman & security notes

This stack is built to run rootless under Podman with no special flags:

- **Fully-qualified images** (`docker.io/library/...`) so Podman won't prompt you
  to choose a registry.
- **Non-root containers** — the app image runs as the built-in `node` user; no
  `privileged`, no host networking, no capabilities added.
- **Named volumes** for both Redis data and receipt data. On rootless Podman this
  avoids the usual bind-mount UID-mapping permission headaches — it just works.
- **Unprivileged port** — the API listens on `8080` (rootless can't bind <1024).
- A `Containerfile` symlink is included since Podman looks for that name by
  default, though `docker-compose.yml` points both runtimes at `Dockerfile`.
- **Always pass `-p receipt-enricher`** to `podman-compose`. It names the built
  images `<project>_<service>`, and a stray `RECEIPT_PROJECT` or
  `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` exported in your shell can poison the project name —
  e.g. an invalid value yields `Error: tag …: invalid reference format` on
  build. The explicit `-p` flag overrides both env vars and the compose `name:`,
  so the build is deterministic regardless of your environment.

**Want the receipt files on your host filesystem** (to inspect the JSON/images)?
Swap the named volume for a bind mount on the `api` and `worker` services:

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data:Z      # :Z applies an SELinux label (Fedora/RHEL)
```

Under **rootless Podman** you'll also likely want the container UID to match
yours so it can write there:

```bash
podman-compose -p receipt-enricher up   # then, if you hit permission errors on ./data:
# add to the api & worker services:   userns_mode: "keep-id"
```

(Docker users can use `./data:/app/data` with no `:Z` and no `userns`.)

Inside compose, `REDIS_URL` and `DATA_DIR` are set for you. The compose file also
reads a few **host-side** variables (with prod-safe defaults) so the same file
can run an isolated second stack: `RECEIPT_API_PORT` (published host port,
default `8080`), `RECEIPT_PROJECT` (compose project name), `OCR_PROVIDER`, and
`RECEIPT_SUITE` (a `io.receipt-enricher.suite` container label). Keep
`PUBLIC_BASE_URL` aligned with the published `host:port` so the API advertises
links that actually resolve. (The acceptance suite uses these — see Testing.)

---

## Local development (without containers)

```bash
npm install
# In separate terminals (needs a Redis on localhost:6379):
npm run server
npm run worker
# optional:
npm run bot
```

---

## Testing

- **Unit/integration (hermetic):** `npm test` — fast, no network, Redis, or keys.
  Details in `test/README.md`.
- **Live extraction checks:** `npm run test:live:vision` / `:tesseract` /
  `:stack` / `:samples` — hit real services and self-skip when prereqs are absent.
- **Acceptance (black-box, containerized):** `bash test/acceptance/run-all.sh`
  builds the stack in containers and drives it from the outside via the CLI and
  raw `curl` (upload → process → done, error cases, and receipt profiles), then
  tears it down. It
  runs **isolated from any live deployment** — its own project name
  (`test-receipt-enricher`) and host port (`18080`) — so it's safe to run on the
  same host as a running stack. Defaults to offline Tesseract; pass `--vision`
  for the Anthropic path. Steps under `cli/` and `rest/` are individually
  runnable. See `test/acceptance/README.md`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`receipts health` fails / API unreachable** — make sure the stack is up
  (`docker compose ps` / `podman-compose ps`) and that the API port is published.
- **Receipt stuck in `queued`** — the worker isn't running or can't reach Redis.
  Check `docker compose logs worker`.
- **Items but no images** — enrichment is off (no `TAVILY_API_KEY`) or Tavily had
  no image for that query. The record will still list the items and prices.
- **Garbled / missing items with Tesseract** — expected for messy photos; add a
  vision key for accurate extraction.
- **Permission errors writing `./data` on Podman** — you switched to a bind
  mount; add `userns_mode: "keep-id"` (see Podman notes) or keep the named volume.
- **`depends_on … condition` ignored** on older `podman-compose` — harmless; the
  app retries its Redis connection automatically, so startup order isn't fatal.
- **`podman compose` → "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"** — that subcommand
  delegates to an external `docker-compose` provider that can't reach the
  rootless Podman socket. Use **`podman-compose`** (hyphenated) instead.
- **Links point at the wrong port** (e.g. `:8080` when you published `:18080`) —
  set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the address you actually published; the API builds
  `statusUrl`/`viewUrl` from it.

## Notes & known limits

- The heuristic Tesseract parser is best-effort; the vision path is the quality
  path. Store detection covers common US chains and is easy to extend in
  `src/parse/receiptParser.js`.
- Records are stored as JSON files (durable, survive a Redis flush). For a
  multi-worker deployment, move the record store into Redis/a DB to avoid the
  read-modify-write race noted in `src/store.js`.
- No auth is included — run it on a trusted network or put it behind a reverse
  proxy if you expose it.
```
